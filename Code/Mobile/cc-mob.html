                Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services wirelessly through the internet, or the cloud. This allows data to be transferred effortlessly from one place to another. For example, when someone wants to get images from a computer to a phone, they put the pictures on the cloud and access them from wherever, whenever. Cloud computing makes it so that you donâ€™t have to download additional software or hardware, so that all you have to do is rent it from your provider.

                        Infrastructure as a Service is the basic use of physical structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise. Infrastructure as a Service is when you rent storage, server, operating system, etc., from a wireless provider. IaaS gives you the computing power to analyze massive amounts of data which are very useful to scientific studies or businesses looking to improve marketing strategies.

It is used with operating systems, development tools on a computer, database management, business analytics, and all of the uses listed under Infrastructure as a Service. Private PaaS servers allow people to manage applications while still keeping privacy. Some companies that use private PaaS servers are Google, Amazon, and Windows.

SaaS is where something is downloaded as a software onto a device. This counts apps, launchers, and all of the uses listed in PaaS and IaaS. SaaS is also a way of transmitting applications over the cloud, hence the word software is in its name. Because of this, Software as a Service frees up time and hassle from managing software and hardware. Some advantages of this service are its painless and hassle free upgrades, its low initial cost, its seamless integration into the computer system, and that it is adopted by many.

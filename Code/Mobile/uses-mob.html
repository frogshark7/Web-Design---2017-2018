                Cloud computing allows businesses to focus on their growth and success rather than focus on the complexities of maintaining and running their own IT services. This saves businesses from buying additional hardware and services, allowing them to invest in more important things. Cloud computing also gives the users a platform that’s easily accessible, meaning that you don’t have to install or configure additional software. Plus, cloud computing is an important choice to consider for businesses in this day of age, since you can expand your business with the snap of a finger and improve its security as well. A study conducted by Exact, a software company, and Pb7 Research validated this by finding that small businesses who adopted cloud computing doubled their profits while seeing 25 percent of additional revenue growth. Cloud computing is extremely viable option to consider. It has survived due to its versatility and because it provides existing infrastructure and services that improve the productivity of companies. Plus, companies only have to pay for the services they use from their provider.

                The cloud has gained alot of support over the years due to many things, but most of all, because of its flexibility. This means that the files needed can be accessed anywhere, at any time, instead of at a certain place during a certain window of time.

                Cloud computing is known to be very efficient. This is because the cloud services provider is responsible for the maintainance and updates, removing all the hassle for the company. Also, cloud services are usually organized, so there aren't any problems finding things.

                With the cloud, communication has become much easier. Now, people can communicate on websites, call others, and write emails. Because of all of this communication, more people collaborate on projects which allows for more productivity.

                When servers go down, everything on it is inaccessible. And since it is entirely random, a server crash could happen right before a project is due. To prevent all of the data from being lost, companies backup their data in case this happens.

                The cloud isn’t always secure and is thus vulnerable to hacking. To keep data from being uncovered, unique passwords along with a cloud service with a secure server should be chosen. Companies should always be vague about their data and should avoid giving specifics if not required.
